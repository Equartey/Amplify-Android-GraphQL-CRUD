# Amplify-Android-GraphQL-CRUD
Simple CRUD app bootstrapped by the Amplify Android library.


### Purpose
The goal of this repo is to provide an example of the missing GraphQL parity between the [Amplify Flutter](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/mutate-data/q/platform/flutter) & [Amplify Android/iOS libraries](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/mutate-data/q/platform/android) 
The primary disjunction being the Flutter library does not support the use of models while Android and iOS do.
